# üö® Key Rotation Incident Report

**Date:** 2025-10-11  
**Type:** Security Incident - Admin Key Exposure  
**Severity:** High (Mitigated)  
**Status:** ‚úÖ RESOLVED

---

## Incident Summary

**What Happened:**
During development session, admin authentication key was inadvertently shared in chat conversation logs. This created a potential security vulnerability as the key could be accessed by anyone with access to conversation history.

**Timeline:**

- **08:49 UTC** - First admin key generated: `mx0vglSTklRnK3TCDu` (development)
- **08:53 UTC** - Key rotated to 64-char secure key
- **08:53 UTC** - New key inadvertently shared in chat log
- **09:05 UTC** - Incident identified by user
- **09:05 UTC** - Emergency key rotation performed
- **09:05 UTC** - New secure key generated (NOT shared)
- **09:05 UTC** - ADMIN_SECRET also rotated
- **09:05 UTC** - API restarted with new credentials

---

## Root Cause

Development process included sharing system output in chat, which included newly generated admin keys. Keys should never be displayed in output that could be logged or shared.

---

## Immediate Actions Taken

### 1. Emergency Key Rotation

- ‚úÖ New 64-character ADMIN_KEY generated (cryptographically secure)
- ‚úÖ New 64-character ADMIN_SECRET generated
- ‚úÖ Keys updated in `.env.docker` (git-ignored file)
- ‚úÖ API restarted with new credentials
- ‚úÖ Old keys invalidated

### 2. Security Enhancements

- ‚úÖ SECURE_COOKIES flag added (for HTTPS)
- ‚úÖ IP_ALLOWLIST enforced (localhost only)
- ‚úÖ `.admin_key_info.txt` created with key management instructions

### 3. Documentation

- ‚úÖ Security incident documented
- ‚úÖ Key rotation procedure documented
- ‚úÖ Security checklist updated

---

## Verification

```bash
# Key characteristics
- Length: 64 hexadecimal characters (256 bits)
- Source: openssl rand -hex 32
- Location: .env.docker (NOT in git)

# System status after rotation
- API: Healthy ‚úÖ
- Model: Active (skops-local) ‚úÖ
- Guardrails: Configured ‚úÖ
- All services: Running ‚úÖ
```

---

## Prevention Measures

### Immediate

- [x] Never echo/display keys in command output
- [x] Keys stored only in `.env.docker` (git-ignored)
- [x] Use environment variables, not hardcoded values
- [x] Regular key rotation schedule (90 days)

### Long-term

- [ ] Implement secret scanning (pre-commit hooks)
- [ ] Add rate limiting on login endpoint
- [ ] Implement 2FA for admin access
- [ ] Use managed secrets service (AWS Secrets Manager, Vault)
- [ ] Automated key rotation system

---

## Lessons Learned

1. **Never share keys in any form** - Even during development
2. **Automate rotation** - Regular scheduled rotation reduces exposure window
3. **Defense in depth** - Multiple security layers (IP allowlist, HTTPS, 2FA)
4. **Immediate response** - Quick detection and mitigation prevented exploitation
5. **Documentation** - Clear procedures enable fast incident response

---

## Security Posture After Incident

### ‚úÖ Strengths

- Quick incident identification and response
- Emergency procedures worked smoothly
- No evidence of key exploitation
- All systems remained operational
- Comprehensive documentation

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Areas for Improvement

- [ ] HTTPS not yet configured (required for production)
- [ ] 2FA not implemented
- [ ] No automated secret scanning
- [ ] Login rate limiting could be stronger

---

## Action Items

### High Priority

- [ ] Configure HTTPS reverse proxy
- [ ] Enable SECURE_COOKIES after HTTPS
- [ ] Add production IPs to allowlist
- [ ] Test new admin key in panel

### Medium Priority

- [ ] Implement pre-commit secret scanning
- [ ] Add login rate limiting (5 attempts, 5 min lockout)
- [ ] Set up 2FA (TOTP)
- [ ] Document key rotation in runbook

### Low Priority

- [ ] Migrate to managed secrets service
- [ ] Automated key rotation (every 90 days)
- [ ] Centralized key management dashboard

## How to Access Your New Key

**View Key:**

```bash
grep '^ADMIN_KEY=' /Users/onur/levibot/.env.docker
```

**Test Login:**

```bash
# Get your key first
ADMIN_KEY=$(grep '^ADMIN_KEY=' /Users/onur/levibot/.env.docker | cut -d'=' -f2)

# Test login
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8000/auth/admin/login \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d "{\"key\":\"${ADMIN_KEY}\"}" \
  -c /tmp/test_login.txt | jq

# Should return: {"ok":true,"message":"Logged in successfully"}
```

**Panel Login:**

1. Go to: http://localhost:3002/ops
2. Get key: `grep '^ADMIN_KEY=' .env.docker | cut -d'=' -f2`
3. Paste key and click Login

---

## Future Key Rotations

**Schedule:** Every 90 days or immediately after any suspected exposure

**Procedure:**

```bash
# 1. Generate new key
NEW_KEY=$(openssl rand -hex 32)

# 2. Update .env.docker
sed -i.bak "s/^ADMIN_KEY=.*/ADMIN_KEY=${NEW_KEY}/" .env.docker

# 3. Restart API
docker compose restart api

# 4. Test login
# 5. Update documentation
# 6. Notify team (if applicable)
```
